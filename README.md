  ## Installation
  Visit [deployed site](add). If you would like to clone, please use the "Code" download button, selecting SSH, HTTP, or GitHub CLI to use or modify on your computer. You may also forking a copy to customize a copy of the site, using mine as a template.

  Be sure to review [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) documentation for environment setup, as well as installing the SDK version 45.0.0 for Expo Go -- the following command will help: `expo update 45.0.0`


  ## Usage
  For this project I used iPhone 13 Pro Max iOS Simulator, and Pixel 4 API 32 Android Emulator for testing mobile environments. You may also run on a physical device.

  If running locally, after downloading, running `npm install` (or `yarn install`) and followed by `npm start` (or `yarn start`) in your terminal at the root level directory. This should download all the required dependencies.

  Make sure your simulator/emulator are open before launching Expo Go.
  
  To launch project on Expo Go, use `expo-cli start --tunnel` to get past any LAN issues. Then `a` to load Android, and / or `i` for iOS. You may also press `w` to view in your browser as opposed to simulators.
  
  If the app ever disconnects from Metro bunder, use `watchman watch-del-all` and `watchman shutdown-server` before restarting.

  ðŸŽ‰ Thank you to my employer (Shipt) and my Engineering Manager @JoeGamble for allowing me to use a portion of my work week to continue learning and improve my React Native skills.

  ## Test
  The great thing about React Native is that you can see your project live while in development; any errors that occur can be updated without needing to restart your connection to the server.
